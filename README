compiled and tested with DMD64 D Compiler v2.059 on ubuntu 12.04

Tested by attacking the service with many multiple concurrent requests that in turn ensures less propability for deadlocks.

Single threaded and non-blocking. Supports many thousands of concurrent requests at any given time. 

HOWTO:

Linux/Unix/Windows:

Install DDT for Eclipse. Execute the generated executable from the project directory like:

~/d2-simple-socket-server$ bin/SimpleServer 
Disable Log: false	Log All: true	Log level: ALL
2012-06-01T18:15:23.5954827Z INFO: Listening on port 1234

This will load the logger properties file in the project directory. If you decide to move the executable, and forget about the logger.properties file it will set LogLevel to ALL by default like this:

~/d2-simple-socket-server$ bin/SimpleServer 
Failed in AbstractLogger constructor.
Falling back to LogLevel.ALL.
To override the log level you'll have to add a logger.properties file in the current directory, that you fill with the property "simpleserver.logger.level=INFO"
